Using the latest Git changes and our development discussion, help me:

### 1. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`**

Include all relevant types of changes such as:

* Modifications to layout or structural components.
* Enhancements related to responsiveness and adaptability across screen sizes.
* General UI or UX behavior improvements.
* Fixes to data synchronization logic and consistency across storage layers.
* Improvements to metadata tracking and system-generated fields.
* Any other changes that we have made to the project.

> Ensure Versioning and Current Date Time 

### 2. **Update `CommitMessage.md`**

Generate a semantic commit message that:

* Summarizes the key updates (e.g., feature, fix, refactor).
* Follows conventional commit message style.
* Optionally includes a description body and version tag.
* Use emojis

> Ensure formatting is clean, professional, and markdown-ready.
