# Schema Fixes Summary

## Problem
The logs showed multiple schema mismatches between the test code and your actual Supabase database schema. The test code was using incorrect field names and referencing non-existent tables.

## Schema Mismatches Fixed

### 1. app_settings Table
**Old (Incorrect):** `key`, `value`, `description`  
**New (Correct):** `setting_key`, `setting_value`, `category`

### 2. public_announcements Table
**Issue:** This table doesn't exist in your schema  
**Fix:** Removed all references to `public_announcements` table

### 3. audit_items Table
**Old (Incorrect):** `action`, `old_values`, `new_values`, `timestamp`, `user_id`  
**New (Correct):** `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `metadata`

### 4. ID Generation Issue
**Issue:** All tables use `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` for `id` column  
**Fix:** Removed manual `id` assignments, let Supabase auto-generate IDs

### 5. Missing Fields
**Added:** `external_id`, `settings` (for organization_profiles), proper audit fields

## Files Updated

### 1. remote_sample_data.dart
- ✅ Fixed `app_settings` field names: `key` → `setting_key`, `value` → `setting_value`, `description` → `category`
- ✅ Removed `public_announcements` function completely
- ✅ Updated `audit_items` to use actual schema: `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `metadata`
- ✅ Added `settings` JSONB field to `organization_profiles`
- ✅ Removed manual `id` assignments (let Supabase auto-generate)
- ✅ Fixed query ordering: `timestamp` → `created_at.desc.nullslast`

### 2. local_sample_data.dart
- ✅ Updated SQLite table schemas to match Supabase (using INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT for local IDs)
- ✅ Added `app_settings` table with correct field names
- ✅ Updated `audit_items` table schema to match Supabase
- ✅ Added `external_id` fields for tracking Supabase IDs
- ✅ Added `settings` field as TEXT (JSON string) in SQLite
- ✅ Updated sample data generation to use correct field names

### 3. supabase_test_page.dart
- ✅ Removed `public_announcements` from pre-auth queries
- ✅ Removed `public_announcements` from sync manager entity registration
- ✅ Removed `createRemotePublicAnnouncements()` call from sample data creation

## Your Actual Database Schema

Based on your provided SQL, your tables have this structure:

```sql
-- app_settings
setting_key, setting_value, category, is_active, created_by, updated_by, ...

-- organization_profiles  
organization_id, name, description, is_active, settings (JSONB), created_by, updated_by, ...

-- audit_items
organization_id, title, description, status, priority, due_date, metadata (JSONB), created_by, updated_by, ...
```

## Expected Results After Fixes

1. **app_settings creation should work** - No more "Could not find 'description' column" errors
2. **No more public_announcements errors** - Table references completely removed
3. **audit_items creation should work** - No more "Could not find 'action' column" errors
4. **ID generation should work** - No more "cannot insert non-DEFAULT value into identity column" errors
5. **Order by queries should work** - No more "column does not exist" errors for timestamp fields

## Remaining RLS Issue

The logs still show RLS (Row Level Security) policy violations:
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "organization_profiles"
```

This means your Supabase tables have RLS enabled but no policies allow the authenticated user to create/read records. You'll need to either:

1. **Add RLS policies** in Supabase dashboard for authenticated users
2. **Temporarily disable RLS** for testing (not recommended for production)

The schema fixes above resolved the field mapping issues, but RLS policies are a separate database security configuration.

## Test the Fixes

Run your Flutter app again and test:
1. ✅ Connection should work (no health check table needed)
2. ✅ Pre-auth queries should work for app_settings
3. ✅ Authentication should work
4. ⚠️ CRUD operations will still fail due to RLS policies (not a schema issue)
5. ✅ Sample data creation should use correct field names
6. ✅ Local→Remote sync should send correct field mappings
7. ✅ Remote→Local sync should query with correct field names

The main improvement is that you'll now see RLS policy errors instead of schema/field mapping errors, which means the code is correctly structured for your database.
