- `NotificationConfig`: Multi-channel notification system
- Pre-configured alert rules for common scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Service Integration
All services work together in a cohesive monitoring ecosystem:

```
SyncAnalyticsService (Core)
    ‚Üì
SyncPerformanceMonitor ‚Üê SyncFailureAnalytics
    ‚Üì                         ‚Üì
SyncHealthDashboard    SyncAlertingService
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time updates via streams
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible alert rules and dashboard widgets
- **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive data gathering and analysis
- **Threshold-Based Monitoring**: Configurable alerting conditions
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete alert and monitoring lifecycle

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Optimized for real-time processing
- **Configurable Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old data
- **Stream-Based Updates**: Minimal memory footprint for real-time data
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk analytics operations

## üìã Usage Example

```dart
// Initialize analytics and monitoring
final analytics = SyncAnalyticsService();
final monitor = SyncPerformanceMonitor(analytics);
final failureAnalytics = SyncFailureAnalytics(analytics, monitor);
final dashboard = SyncHealthDashboard(analytics, monitor, failureAnalytics);
final alerting = SyncAlertingService(analytics, monitor, failureAnalytics);

// Start monitoring
analytics.startHealthMonitoring();
monitor.startMonitoring();
failureAnalytics.startAnalysis();
dashboard.setLayout(SyncHealthDashboard.createOverviewLayout());

// Track operations
final opId = analytics.startOperation(
  entityType: 'user_profile',
  collection: 'user_profiles',
  operationType: SyncOperationType.upload,
);

analytics.updateOperation(opId, itemsProcessed: 10);
analytics.completeOperation(opId, itemsSuccessful: 10);

// Get insights
final performance = analytics.getPerformanceMetrics();
final health = analytics.getCurrentHealthStatus();
final alerts = alerting.getActiveAlerts();
```
