# Phase 1 Refactoring: Additional Enums Centralization

## Overview

This document summarizes the additional enum standardization work done as part of Phase 1 of the Universal Sync Manager refactoring plan. The primary goal was to move all remaining enum definitions to the central `usm_sync_enums.dart` file to ensure consistent type definitions and reduce duplication.

## Files Updated

1. **Central Enums File**
   - `lib/src/config/usm_sync_enums.dart`: Added multiple enums from various service files

2. **Service Files**
   - `lib/src/services/usm_batch_sync_service.dart`: Removed local enums
   - `lib/src/services/usm_conflict_resolver.dart`: Removed local enums
   - `lib/src/services/usm_enhanced_conflict_resolver.dart`: Removed local enums
   - `lib/src/services/usm_smart_sync_scheduler.dart`: Removed local enums
   - `lib/src/services/usm_sync_event_bus.dart`: Removed local enums

## Enums Centralized

The following enums were moved to the central enums file:

1. From `usm_batch_sync_service.dart`:
   - `BatchType`
   - `SystemResources`

2. From `usm_conflict_resolver.dart`:
   - `ConflictType`

3. From `usm_enhanced_conflict_resolver.dart`:
   - `EnhancedConflictType`
   - `EnhancedConflictResolutionStrategy`

4. From `usm_sync_event_bus.dart`:
   - `EventPriority`

5. From `usm_smart_sync_scheduler.dart`:
   - `ScheduleEventType`
   - `EntitySyncStrategy`
   - `SchedulingStrategyType`
   - `RecommendationType`
   - `RecommendationImpact`
   - `SystemResourceLevel`

## Benefits

1. **Improved consistency**: All enum types are now defined in a single location
2. **Reduced duplication**: Eliminated duplicate or similar enum definitions
3. **Better maintainability**: Changes to enums only need to be made in one place
4. **Cleaner code**: Service files now focus on functionality instead of type definitions
5. **Enhanced discoverability**: Easier for developers to find and understand all available enum options

## Next Steps

1. Continue with other phases of the refactoring plan
2. Update any references to these enums in other files
3. Consider grouping related enums within the central file for better organization
4. Update documentation to reflect the new centralized enum structure
