# Phase 2 Refactoring Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Extracted Classes to Dedicated Files

We've successfully moved the following classes to their own files:

- `SyncCollection` has been moved from `usm_universal_sync_manager.dart` to `src/models/usm_sync_collection.dart`
- `AppSyncAuthConfiguration` has been moved from `usm_universal_sync_manager.dart` to `src/models/usm_app_sync_auth_configuration.dart`

### 2. Updated Imports and Removed Duplicated Code

- Updated `usm_universal_sync_manager.dart` to import the extracted classes instead of defining them
- Added proper documentation to the new class files
- Improved organization by keeping model classes in the models directory

### 3. Updated Main Export File

- Added exports for the new model files in `universal_sync_manager.dart`
- Added export for the centralized enums in `usm_sync_enums.dart`

## Remaining Issues

1. **Name Conflicts**: There's a conflict with `NetworkCondition` which is defined in both `usm_sync_enums.dart` and `usm_sync_scheduler.dart`. This is causing an export conflict. 

2. **Test Verification**: Need to verify that all the changes don't break existing functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Name Conflicts**: We need to either:
   - Hide the conflicting name in the export directive
   - Remove one of the duplicated definitions (preferable as part of Phase 1)

2. **Update Client Code**: If there are any direct references to the old class locations, they need to be updated.

3. **Proceed to Phase 3**: Once the name conflicts are resolved, we can proceed to Phase 3 of the refactoring plan.

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Better Code Organization**: Classes are now in more appropriate locations following the project's organization patterns.

2. **Improved Maintainability**: Each class now has its own file, making it easier to find and modify specific components.

3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Added more detailed documentation to the extracted classes.

4. **Cleaner Dependencies**: The main manager class now has clearer dependencies by importing what it needs instead of defining it.
