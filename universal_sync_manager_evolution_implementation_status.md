Looking at the implementation plan and our current progress, let me check what we've completed and what's still needed: Let me check the current status by looking at the main export file and our task completion summaries: Based on my analysis of the current project structure and the implementation plan, here's the status of the Universal Sync Manager implementation:

## 🎯 **Current Implementation Status**

### ✅ **COMPLETED Phases & Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Core Abstraction Layer** ✅
- ✅ Task 1.1: Backend Adapter Interface (Complete)
- ✅ Task 1.2: Sync Operation Service (Complete) 
- ✅ Task 1.3: Platform Abstraction Layer (Complete)

**Phase 2: Backend Adapter Implementations** ✅
- ✅ Task 2.1: PocketBase Adapter (Complete)
- ✅ Task 2.3: Supabase Adapter (Complete)
- ❌ Task 2.2: Firebase Adapter (Not implemented - marked as [ToDo])

**Phase 3: Configuration System** ✅
- ✅ Task 3.1: Sync Configuration Management (Complete)
- ✅ Task 3.2: Entity Registration System (Complete)

**Phase 4: Advanced Sync Features** ✅
- ✅ Task 4.1: Intelligent Sync Optimization (Complete)
- ✅ Task 4.2: Enhanced Conflict Resolution (Complete)

**Phase 5: Monitoring and Diagnostics** ✅
- ✅ Task 5.1: Sync Analytics and Monitoring (Complete)
- ✅ Task 5.2: Debugging and Recovery Tools (Complete)

**Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure** ✅
- ✅ Task 6.1: Test Framework Setup (Complete)

## 🚧 **REMAINING Tasks:**

### **Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure** (Remaining)
- ✅**Task 6.2**: Integration Testing Framework
- ✅**Task 6.3**: Performance Benchmarking Suite 
- ✅**Task 6.4**: End-to-end Testing Scenarios

### **Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment** (Not Started)
- ✅**Task 7.1**: API Documentation Generation
- ✅ **Task 7.2**: Migration Guides and Examples
- ✅**Task 7.3**: Package Publishing and Distribution (Completed - Local Usage Setup)

### **Missing Backend Adapter**
- ❌ **Task 2.2**: Firebase Adapter Implementation

## 📊 **Implementation Progress: ~85% Complete**

### **What's Ready to Use:**
✅ Complete core architecture with backend abstraction  
✅ Working PocketBase and Supabase adapters  
✅ Full configuration and entity registration system  
✅ Advanced sync features (optimization, conflict resolution)  
✅ Comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools  
✅ Complete test framework infrastructure  

### **What's Missing for Full Production Readiness:**
🔄 Firebase adapter (for broader backend support)  
🔄 Integration testing framework  
🔄 Performance benchmarking  
🔄 End-to-end test scenarios  
🔄 API documentation  
🔄 Migration guides  

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps:**

You have **3 main options** depending on your priorities:

### **Option 1: Complete Testing Infrastructure** 
Continue with Phase 6 tasks (6.2, 6.3, 6.4) for comprehensive testing coverage

### **Option 2: Add Firebase Backend Support**
Implement Task 2.2 for Firebase adapter to support all major backends

### **Option 3: Focus on Documentation & Deployment** 
Move to Phase 7 for production-ready documentation and publishing

**Recommendation:** Since you have a solid working Universal Sync Manager with excellent testing tools, I'd suggest **Option 1** (complete testing infrastructure) to ensure bulletproof reliability before wider deployment.

Would you like me to proceed with one of these options, or do you have a different preference for what to tackle next?
