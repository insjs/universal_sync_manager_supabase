# Live Testing Framework for Universal Sync Manager

This directory contains comprehensive live testing scenarios for validating the Universal Sync Manager against real backend services.

## Overview

The live testing framework follows a phased approach to validate sync functionality with actual backend services, starting with PocketBase and expanding to other backends.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: PocketBase Live Testing âœ…
- **Objective**: Validate USM sync functionality against a real PocketBase instance
- **Components**:
  - Schema creation and deployment
  - Local SQLite database setup
  - Bidirectional sync testing
  - Data integrity validation

### Phase 2: Supabase Live Testing ðŸ”„
- **Objective**: Validate USM sync with Supabase PostgreSQL backend
- **Components**: Similar to Phase 1 but with Supabase-specific configurations

### Phase 3: Multi-Backend Testing ðŸ”„
- **Objective**: Test sync across multiple backends simultaneously
- **Components**: Cross-backend data consistency and conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Performance and Stress Testing ðŸ”„
- **Objective**: Validate performance under realistic load conditions
- **Components**: Large dataset sync, concurrent user simulation, network condition testing

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Flutter/Dart development environment
   - PocketBase server (local or remote)
   - SQLite support
   - Network connectivity

2. **Run Phase 1 Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd test/live_tests/phase1_pocketbase
   dart run tests/full_sync_test.dart
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   - Test results are logged to console and files
   - Validation reports are generated automatically
   - Performance metrics are captured for analysis

## Test Data Strategy

- **Synthetic Data**: Generated test data following realistic patterns
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data integrity across sync operations
- **Conflict Simulation**: Deliberate conflicts to test resolution mechanisms
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, large datasets, network failures

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Real-time sync progress monitoring
- Comprehensive test result reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- Error logging and analysis
- Data integrity verification

## Security Considerations

- Test environments are isolated from production
- Sensitive data is never used in testing
- Authentication credentials are configurable
- All test data is cleanly removable
